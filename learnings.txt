basic difference between devops and mlops?
topics covered :
1. project structure 
2. what is dvc : components, 
3. git commands
4. basic python : 

consolidating the params in a single file.
git version control for versioning


in ml systems: a part from code (we use git), we need to manage the data and model
dvs - helps data version control and model
dvs built on git..

DVC tracks ML models and data sets.
DVC built to make mL modles shareable and repetable.


in git : we cannot store large files, we just push code here.

in DVC : 
- .dvc is pushed to git repo not data.
- local
- remote storage 

components available in DVC and importent parts

-  params.yml : centralized file contains paramters and config details

- dvc.yml : stores all the stages we implement like 
             :- data gatering;datap reprocessing;training;evaluation
